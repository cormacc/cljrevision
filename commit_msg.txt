feat: Implemented archive command with zip creation and checksum generation

- Added archive command that creates <ID>-v<REV>.zip files containing build artifacts
- Respects :dest key with <REV> placeholder replacement for artifact renaming
- Includes SHA512 checksums for individual artifacts when :chk is not false
- Generates SHA512 checksum file for the archive itself (.zip.sha512)
- Uses :archive destination from releasables.yaml configuration
- Provides clear progress output during archiving process
- Handles missing source files gracefully with warnings
- Updated help text to move archive from planned to available commands
- Added archive command to dispatch table

Example:
  ./rel archive
  Creates: ./build/archives/revision-v1.1.0.zip
           ./build/archives/revision-v1.1.0.zip.sha512
