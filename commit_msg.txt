feat: Implemented package command for combined build and archive workflow

- Added package command that executes build followed by archive
- Provides single-command workflow for creating distributable packages
- Updated help text to move package from planned to available commands
- Added package command to dispatch table
- Maintains clear progress output showing both build and archive phases

Example:
  ./rel package
  Runs: build steps → create archive → generate checksums
  Creates: ./build/archives/revision-v1.1.0.zip + .sha512

This completes the core release management workflow:
  major/minor/patch → build → package → deploy
