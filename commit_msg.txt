feat: Enhanced deploy command with artifact renaming and <REV> placeholder support

- Added :dest key support for artifacts in releasables.yaml
- Implemented <REV> placeholder replacement with current version (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Refactored deploy functionality into focused private functions:
  - deploy-exec-steps: Execute custom deployment steps
  - deploy-artefact-to: Deploy single artifact with filename logic
  - deploy-to: Coordinate deployment to single target
  - determine-dest-filename: Handle destination filename determination
- Removed ineffective test file that tested mock implementations
- All existing functionality preserved and tested

Example usage:
  artefacts:
    - src: "target/app.jar"
      dest: "myapp-<REV>.jar"    # becomes myapp-1.2.3.jar
    - src: "dist/archive.tar.gz"  
      dest: "releases/v<REV>/app-<REV>.tar.gz"  # becomes releases/v1.2.3/app-1.2.3.tar.gz
